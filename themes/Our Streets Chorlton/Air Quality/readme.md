Open Data Manchester have installed two Earthsense Zephyr solar-powered air quality sensors to measure air quality at selected locations in Chorlton and Chorlton Park during 2021 as part of the Our Streets Chorlton project.

The sensors will be measuring Nitrous Oxide (NO), Nitrous Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3) and other microscopic particles that come from industry, traffic and fires, all of which are known to have an impact on our health if we are exposed to high concentrations.

One unit will be permanently located at Chorlton’s ‘Four Banks’ crossroad of Wilbraham Road and Barlow Moor Road, with the other rotated between the three chosen ‘mini project’ locations of a school, a trading area and a residential street.

All data collected will be made openly available for everyone to access, explore, use and share.

The sensors only measure air-quality data and do not collect personally identifiable information.
